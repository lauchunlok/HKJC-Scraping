# HKJC-Scraping-

The project is aimed to help gamblers building up their own horse racing database for betting strategies. It consists of 4 scripts/notebooks, covering 4 different pages: 1. Race Result, 2. Horse Form Records, 3. Sectional Time & Position and 4. Race Card. With these pages information, you have more than enough data to do your own feature engineering. Happy yet cautious betting and win more!

Example page:
1. https://racing.hkjc.com/racing/information/english/Racing/LocalResults.aspx?RaceDate=2021/03/31
2. https://racing.hkjc.com/racing/information/English/Horse/Horse.aspx?HorseId=HK_2018_C453&Option=1
3. https://racing.hkjc.com/racing/information/english/Racing/DisplaySectionalTime.aspx?RaceDate=31/03/2021&RaceNo=1
4. https://racing.hkjc.com/racing/information/English/racing/RaceCard.aspx

### Race Result
In this page, the script will crawl the result table and prize money. You can change the number of years of crawling by specifying YEAR_START and YEAR_END on the top of the script. It takes around 10 mintues to complete one month. So on average, it takes an hour and a half to complete one year given that less/no horse racing in July to Augest.
